This static website was designed with a directory structure to facilitate easy navigation. Its primary goal is to connect the website owner with customers seamlessly. The site serves as a comprehensive platform that offers quick access to key information, promotes the business, provides contact options, and fosters a strong online presence. The website also showcases the potential of front-end features.

## Design

The website is designed with three separate pages. This is to ensure ease of use, and for the length of each page to remain concise on a mobile device. It has an intuitive interface with clear navigation. This is emphasised with colour and imagery, allowing for quick access to facilities and respective socials.


  ### Colour Scheme

  There is a great emphasis on colour for this website. I wanted it to reflect the positive association that can be had with hobbies. I wanted it to be playful for children and adults alike; perhaps even evoke a sense of nostalgia for older users. <br>
  The colour scheme of the website illustrates variety and fun through the colour palette. 100s of Thousands were the inspiration for this palette of choice.

  ![Hero Image](assets/images/hero-sprinkles-1.webp)

  This palette holds the pastel colours found in the hero image. They are used throughout the website where a solid colour is needed to make wording stand out from the hero image behind it. Many of the colours were extracted from this image and are accented throughout the website.

  ![Hobby Website Colour Palette](docs/sprinkles-23.png)

  This palette extracts the more vibrant colours found in the hero image. It is used primarily for defining elements such as headings, areas of importance or quick reference.

  ![Hobby Website Colour Palette](docs/sprinkles-20.png)

  Both colour palettes were created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.


  ### Typography


  [Fredericka The Great](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredericka+the+Great?preview.text=Fredericka%20The%20Great&query=Poppins)

  ![Fredericka The Great Font](docs/fonts/fredericka_the_great.png.PNG)

    - This font has an illustration-type quality to it, which reflects the theme of the website. It adds some fun, looks hand-drawn and mirrors the chosen style of favicon. It is illustrative, yet has a structural integrity and readability to it. Furthermore, it effortlessly reflects what the website is about. This is primarily used for the website heading "Hobby".

  [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.text=Poppins&query=Poppins)

  ![Poppins Font](docs/fonts/poppins.png.PNG)

    - This is a legible, sans serif font with many varieties of weight to choose from. It is versatile and accomodates all structural styling needs. It is a very accessible font, and easy to read. This is used for more word heavy content sections of the website.

  Both fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).


  ### Imagery

  All images were source from [Raw Pixel](https://www.rawpixel.com/).


  ### Favicon

  I designed this favicon especially for the webpage using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). I chose an illustrated 'h'. This was the best way to reflect the nature of the website. The paintbrush icon used in the header was also a contender (along with other hobby - related instruments), however it did not translate as clearly on the broswer tab compared to lettering. The 'h' has an illustrative quality to it, again reflecting the theme and typographies used throughout.


  ### Wireframes

  Wireframes were created for desktop (1920px x 1080px), iPad (768px x 1024px) and iPhone 12Pro (436px x 867px).

| Colour | - Block colours are used where there's writing so they do not get lost in the sprinkles background. | ---| ![colour About Page](docs/features/colour_about_page.PNG)  ![colour Discover Page](docs/features/colour_discover_page.PNG) ![colour Sign Up Page](docs/features/colour_signup_page.PNG) ![colour Response Page](docs/features/colour_response_page.PNG) |
| Footer | - A focal point that stands out clearly with a white background. This is carried throughout each page as it is essential to create a strong social following as the concept of the website is community-based. | - Expand footer to include contact details, T&Cs, Privacy Policy etc. | ![Footer](docs/features/footer.PNG) |
| About | General landing page that describes what the website & what it is about. | - Add an image carousel. <br> - Add a map listing all hobbies in the area. <br> - Add a preview section of reviews from former clientel. | ![About Page](docs/features/hobby_about_page.PNG) |

They are displayed in rows of three on desktop and collapse responsively with decreasing screen size. This page illustrates what is available through the website with simple visual cues. | Once data is collected from those wanting to promote their business, club or facility it could be utilized across the website. Each hobby displayed would connect to the organisations offering those services. This would also include: <br> - Links to their socials, webpages, features and contact details. <br> - Add filter column to the directory with features such as "Onsite Parking", "Wheelchair Accessible" and "Sensory Friendly" to name a few.

| Response | - Only activated when the user clicks the 'Subscribe' button for the signup page. It is there to inform the user they have been successful with their subscription. <br> - Home button below notifcation to redirect users. | --- | ![Response Page](docs/features/hobby_response_page.PNG) |

  ### Accessibility

  The entire website was designed with a responsive-first ethos in mind. Some best practices implemented were:

   - Using semantic HTML.
   - Good used of colour contrast throughout the website.
   - Using alt attributes to create acurate descriptions of each image.
   - All pages are responsive for various media screen sizes.
